Problem:
- Suppose you would like to create a pack of trading cards (items). Each card has a rarity associated with it.
  There are five rarity options to choose from with their designated ranking. Common (1), Uncommon (2), Rare (3),
  Very Rare (4), Ultra Rare (5). You would like to manufacturer a finite amount of packs X which have a fixed amount of items
  you can get per pack Y. This means you will need to manufacture at least X*Y different total items to fill each pack. However,
  You would like in some way to have the odds of opening an item in this pack reflect the associated rarity of the item. Using
  this script, you can input a list of items with a rarity ranking and a total number of items to batch. It will output
  recommended odds to use for each item.
